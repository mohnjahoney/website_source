A 'dunder' (double underscores) in Python (also known as a magic method) are the functions within classes having two prefix and suffix underscores in the function name. These are normally used for operator overloading (eg, \_\_init\_\_, \_\_add\_\_, \_\_len\_\_, \_\_repr\_\_, etc). For this post we will build a customized class for vectors to understand how the magic methods can be used to make life easier.
