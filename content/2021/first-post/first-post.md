TESTING ghp-import

This is my first post in the remodeled version of my website.

I had a few goals in this remodel:

- Continue with pelican as a site generator
- Use jupyter notebooks as a content source
- Have a "nice" directory structure
- Host on GitHub
- Allow custom javascript for interactive demos

While these targets seemed relatively modest, it took some doing even with the many resources available.
Luckily, Jack McKew's blog seems to have a similar set of goals.
My goal then became to adapt his website.

I have this more or less up and running, but will continue to pare down and fill in content.
Look for the source soon on my GH page.
