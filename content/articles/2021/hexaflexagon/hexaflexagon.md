Hexaflexagons are strange, paper creatures made of origami and a sprinkle of magic.

"But it looks like a hexagonal coaster for my coffee..", you say, "what's cool about that?"

What's cool is that this coaster has *three* sides!

There are many great resources that discuss how to fold them and also about the mathematics underneath.

I was interested in making a *custom* hexaflexagon - one where I could choose an image for each of the three sides.

I made this during COVID and was thinking about all of the kids stuck at home who needed neat projects to stimulate their minds.
So it was important for me to make this eminently shareable.
I used p5js (and its online editor) - a fun language and a cool tool.

Without further ado, go check it out!

Open the tool, drag in three images of your choice, rotate and scale them to suit your fancy, generate the composite image, download, print, cut out, and fold!

Here's an

to get you started.

Please drop me a line if you had fun with this or come up with an interesting twist.
