Hexaflexagons are strange, paper creatures made of origami and a sprinkle of magic.

"But it looks like a hexagonal coaster for my coffee..", you say, "what's cool about that?"

What's cool is that this coaster has *three* sides!

You will find that there are many great resources that discuss how to create these cool objects and also about the mathematics underneath.

- [Martin Gardner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415056.Hexaflexagons_and_Other_Mathematical_Diversions)
- [Vi Hart](http://vihart.com/hexaflexagons/)

The designs on these versions are largely drawn by hand.
Or if they are printed, they appear to be created in Photoshop or something.

## Make a *custom* version!

I wanted to make one where I could choose my own image for each of the three sides.
And I wanted to make a tool for anyone else to do that too!

Go check it out!

I made this during COVID and was thinking about all of the kids stuck at home who needed neat projects to stimulate their minds.
So it was important for me to make this eminently shareable.
I used p5js (and its online editor) - a fun language and a cool tool.

Open the tool, drag in three images of your choice, rotate and scale them to suit your fancy, generate the composite image, download, print, cut out, and fold!

Here's an image to get you started.

You can play with the code for the HFG tool [here](https://editor.p5js.org/mohnjahoney/sketches/-fVgtBMTP).

Please drop me a line if you had fun with this or come up with an interesting twist.
