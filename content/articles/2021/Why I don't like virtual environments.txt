Why I don't like virtual environments.

In a nutshell:
I think the power of code is not so much in what it can do, but how it can interoperate.

Some package that rapidly parses CSV files is not going to get me too revved up.
But combine that with a few well-functioning analysis and plotting tools and you're on your way to the pandas + matplotlib system - immensely powerful.

Another way of saying this is: You know what really sucks? When some big piece of code like MS Word exports a PDF and the fonts are all wrong.. and things like that.
Microsoft is shipping me 300 MB of application that has 14 drop-down menus and 73 buttons, but it can't export properly.

How does this happen?

It comes down to fragility of code.

Fragility comes about when we are not properly tested, when we are not battle-hardened.

Humans are lazy.
Isolated code becomes fragile.
We tend to solve problems by adding instead of subtracting.
If we allow ourselves to protect code by isolating it in a virtual environment, it will become bloated and fragile.
